# Directions For Installing Flask-User Basic App

This repo contains installation instructions for Python Version 3.8.2 and 3.10.1 

## Installation for 3.8.2:

- >venv\scripts\activate.bat
- >python basic_app.py 
- In a browser go to localhost:5000

## Installation for 3.10.1:

- >venvTen\scripts\activate.bat
- >python basic_app.py 
- In a browser go to localhost:5000

The codebase contains virtual environments for 3.8 and 3.10 that already have the appropriate libraries and python executables installed.  However, requirements files for both 3.8 and 3.10 have been generated.  This should allow you to create the virtual environments from scratch by typing 

pip install -r <requirements filename>.  

For 3.8 use requirements.txt.  For 3.10 use requirementsTen.txt
